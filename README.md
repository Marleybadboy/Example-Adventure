## About
Example Adventure is a 2D Roguelike game. The player's goal is to survive as long as possible in the arena. The player has various attack variants at his disposal and in order to survive in random places there appear finds. Unlike other games, the player creates opponents in a special editor by scaling the difficulty level. The more opponents he creates, the more they will appear in the arena!

### World
The game is divided into main menus and arena scenes.

#### Arenas

The arenas are loaded asynchronously using Addressable Assets which affects the size and smoothness of loading each arena. 
This also makes it easier to add more arenas which are selected randomly.
